## Concept

## 1. Company Certification in Industry Fusion (IF)

Every company participating in Industry Fusion must undergo a **Know Your Customer (KYC)** process to obtain a **Certificate of Authenticity**.  
Once verified, the company can purchase this certificate, which enables it to certify its products on the platform.


## 2. Certificate Issuance Process

Using an open-source service, each company‚Äôs certificate request is received and processed as follows:

- A **Hedera account** and **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** document are created in the **Hedera File Service (HFS)**.
- The **public key** of the Hedera account is stored in the company‚Äôs IF account.
- The **private key** is securely delivered to the user and is **never stored** on the platform.


## 3. Role of the DID Document

The **DID document** serves as the foundational identity for managing certificates.  
It supports key lifecycle operations such as:

- Certificate revocation
- Certificate reissuance


## 4. Issuing Digital Product Passports (DPP)

Upon successful creation of the Hedera account and DID:

- The company can issue **product certificates** in the form of **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**.
- These VCs are recorded on **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)** for transparency and immutability.


## 5. Verifiable Credential Creation and Signing

- VCs can be issued individually or in batches.
- The company‚Äôs **DID certificate** acts as the **ownership identity**.
- VCs are **digitally signed** using the company‚Äôs **private key**, securely provided by user in UI and transmitted for single use.


## 6. Ownership Transfer and VC Reissuance

When a product (e.g., a machine) changes ownership (e.g., from manufacturer to end user):

- The existing VC is **revoked**.
- A new VC is issued with:
  - The **new owner‚Äôs DID**
  - A **digital signature** using the new owner‚Äôs private key


## 7. Verifiable Credentials for Dataspace Contracts

VCs are also issued for **Industry Fusion Dataspace Contracts**.  
These credentials:

- Reference the **DIDs of the participating data-sharing parties**
- Ensure **secure and verifiable authenticity** for the contractual relationship
- Reference the **VC of the digital product/machine in context of data sharing**


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All cryptographic keys are handled securely, and private keys are never retained by the platform.
